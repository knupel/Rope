## Available in the Library

### State
`R_State` is a static class to store differents environment variables from PApplet and events. It's inspired from `React` state.

### CORE package core
Collection Constants set, and Processing clone and improve functions, and glsl function and more useful feature.

### VECTOR package
A collection of vector class, inspired from `PVector` and `vec` function from `GLSL`
float precision:
`vec2` `vec3` and `vec4` with all operation from `PVector` and few more possibilities.
Plus `vec5` and `vec6` to store data.

note: class vec is note write with Uppercase RVec, or Vec for the first letter like is done usualy. The reason is due of the number of time where you must write this Classes, it's possible to accept is a type, like in GLSL!!!

integer precision:
`ivec2` `ivec3` `ivec4` with few operation
and `ivec5` and `ivec6` to store data.

boolean precision:
`bvec2` `bvec3` `bvec4` `bvec5` `bvec6`.

### GUI package gui
you can find class do build `R_Slider`, `R_Knob`, `R_Dropdown`, `R_Button`, `R_Apple_Bar`, `R_Palette`, `R_Board`

### MESH package rope
you can find in this package différents classes to create triangle `R_Face`, `R_Node`, `R_Bloc` and Bloc manager `R_Megabloc`, also `R_Plane`...

### PIXO package rope
Work around the pixel to add it few useful functions and variables, to change, store colour, manage motion, manage pixel cloud. 

Can be help when you want create a particles world.
The main classes are `R_Pixo`, `R_Moxo`, `R_Nubo`

### R_Image package rope
`R_Image` is an extends of `PImage` to store a little more infos, like name or path. You find also `R_Image_Manger` to use a list of `R_Image`. `R_Pattern` can help to create a differents random `PGraphics` with noise or marble pattern.

### SVG
classes to create svg rendering like the last `Illustrator` protocol.

### Colour
classes to create and manage colour palette.

### COSTUME package costume
`vertex()` and `vertexBezier()` method with direct acces via the `vec` type.
Collection of shape classes in the costume package : 
`R_Star`, `R_Polygon`, `R_Chose`, `R_Virus`, `R_Primitive`, `R_Circle`, `R_Bezier`, `R_Icosahedron`, `R_House`
